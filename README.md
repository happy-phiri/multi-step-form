## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

• Complete each step of the sequence
• Go back to a previous step to update their selections
• See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
• View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
• See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
• Receive form validation messages if:
• A field has been missed
• The email address is not formatted correctly
• A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

### My process

Built with
• Semantic HTML5 markup
• React - JS library for building UI
• Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
• React Router 6 - For page routing
• Context API - For global state management
• CSS Grid
• Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me strengthen my understanding of React components and managing state across multiple steps of a form. Using React's Context API made it easier to manage global state without prop drilling, and React Router 6 provided efficient navigation between steps.

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to Frontend Mentor for the challenge and their structured project template. It was a great learning experience that helped me enhance my understanding of React, Tailwind CSS, and multi-step forms.
